<H2>Fuzzy sets for Ada</H2>
<p>The current version includes
distributions of string edit, interval arithmetic and simple components 
packages. It provides implementations of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Confidence factors with the operations not, and, or, xor, +, *;</li>
  <li>Classical fuzzy sets with the set-theoretic operations and the operations 
  of the possibility theory;</li>
  <li>Intuitionistic fuzzy sets with the operations on them;</li>
  <li>Fuzzy logic based on the intuitionistic fuzzy sets and the possibility 
  theory;</li>
  <li>Fuzzy numbers both integer and floating-point ones with conventional 
  arithmetical operations;</li>
  <li>Dimensioned fuzzy numbers;</li>
  <li>Fuzzy linguistic variables and sets of linguistic variables with operations on 
  them;</li>
	<li>Dimensioned fuzzy linguistic variables and sets;</li>
  <li>String-oriented I/O is supported;</li>
	<li>GUI interface based on GTK+ (The GIMP Toolkit) with fuzzy set editors, truth values widgets 
	and renderers, linguistic variables sets editors.</li>
  </ul>
